# Project for Chapter 09

To familiarize myself with the Jack language in prepartaion for writing the compiler and the OS, I'm to write a program in Jack. 

Brainstorming some ideas:

1. Extension of the Square project that exists as an example--maybe could have another square on screen that tries to run away from your square? 
2. Very short text game. Could port over my silly rock paper scissors bet game.
