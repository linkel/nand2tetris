# nand2tetris
I've been curious about the course nand2tetris for a while now. Finally decided to take the plunge and go through the textbook and course materials. 

## What is this?
nand2tetris is a course where God gives you a NAND gate and you build upwards until you get to Tetris. 

## Progress
Currently building the chips in project 01. Rest of folders are untouched.
