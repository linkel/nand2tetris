# nand2tetris
Nand2tetris is a really cool course available completely free on the internet. It's nuts! I am currently working on project 5 and stunned by the quality of the course materials and how fun it is to work through the assignments. 

It's about starting with a NAND-gate and then building the rest of the logical chips, building an ALU, sequential chips, learning the Hack computer's assembly language, and exploring computer architecture until you've built enough parts to write Tetris and run it on the computer you wrote. 

## Progress

- Nov 2018: Started course end of Nov 2018.
- Dec 2018: Became super stumped by sequential chips in Project 3 and also took a break to focus on career change. 
- Aug 2019: Resumed the course and understood sequential chips much better (data flip flop, register/bits, tick tock)
- Aug 24, 2019: Finished project 4, the intro to Hack assembly language.
- Mar 2020: After a long break due to switching gears to Skiena, I have returned! Got the Memory chip working.
- Mar 19, 2020: The CPU chip is very buggy right now.
    - Note: I can specify bus pins on the out by writing `out[0..14]=thingthatis15wide`. I didn't know (or forgot) I could do it on the left side too.
